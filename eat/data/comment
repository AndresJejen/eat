The field rotation angle (FRA) information in "sites.csv" is meant to
be consistent with the memo "pol-foci-v4.pdf" on the EHT wiki.

Note that the FRA for APEX changed in 2017: "... the field rotation
angle was the parallactic angle *minus* the elevation angle for 2016
and before. ... Starting in 2017, the PI230 receiver was used instead.
This is installed at the right Nasmyth focus, resulting in a field
rotation angle that is the parallactic angle *plus* the elevation
angle."
